# Everyday sites - basically, this should be such that the interval is:
#  - not less than what the longest crawl would be (otherwise the crawl would never end because it would 
#    keep picking up this content over and over.  (Techinically it would probably end at some point, but not after indexing
#    the content more than once.
#  - less than 24 hours so that the spider will be able to fetch it the next day.  (If it is set for 24 hrs exactly, then
#    the next fetch time would most likely be set for after the next crawl run...  
#
# Let's use 14 hrs as our interval.  3600 seconds in an hour, so 14 * 3600
